Phoebe: The pandemic makes me feel like shit, but I’m, I’m really trying my best.
Jeff: Hm… I see.
<<make Jeff nice>>
Jeff: Good thing the pandemic originated from China, so it won't last long, haha...
Jeff: Ha... Uhm, but yeah...
<<make Jeff normal>>
Jeff: I know, the pandemic takes a toll on all of us. This article needs to be finished by tomorrow but let me know if you need any support. I think...
Jeff: Yeah, I could give Susanne parts of the article to read if that would help you.
<<make Phoebe annoyed>>
Phoebe: No need to get racist, but...
<<make Phoebe normal>>
Phoebe: Thanks, Jeff. That would actually be great. Your joke was still not funny though. 
Jeff: Alright, alright. I didn't mean it like that. Take care.
<<make Phoebe apologize>>
Phoebe: Yeah. Bye.

<<elseif $shy is true>>
<<make Phoebe embarrassed>>
Phoebe: But, yeah... It's almost done anyways, so...
Jeff: Hm. I get this, but maybe push a little harder. 
Phoebe: I don’t think...
<<make Phoebe annoyed>>
Phoebe: forget it.
Jeff: Well, I can give you until tomorrow.
<<make Jeff bossy>>
Jeff: But I need you to organize a little better. Lately this happens more often.
Jeff: We can’t get lazy just because we're home alone, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Sure, Jeff. I'll send it to you tomorrow.
<<make Jeff normal>>
Jeff: Alright. Good luck! 

<<else>>
<<make Phoebe angry>>
Phoebe: If you wouldn't constantly be bugging me about this, it might have been finished already. Alright?!
<<make Jeff bossy>>
Jeff: Ey! No need to get cocky with me.
Jeff: You millenials always think you can just start whining and push your responsibilities onto someone else.
Jeff: Your projects have been late for a whole month! A <i>month!</i>
Jeff: Get your shit together, Phoebe, or your behavior will have serious consequences.
<<make Phoebe annoyed>>
Phoebe: Sure. Whatever.
