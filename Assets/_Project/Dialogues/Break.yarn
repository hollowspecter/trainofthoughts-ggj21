<<make Lucy smile>>
Lucy: Sure. That's all I want.
<<make Phoebe embarrassed>>
Phoebe: But...
Phoebe: Don't get me wrong, Lucy. But I also need you to step down a little when I'm feeling bad. 
Phoebe: I know you just want to help. And I love that. 
Phoebe: But that's not how it works for me. 
<<make Lucy normal>>
Lucy: I see. 
<<make Lucy smile>>
Lucy: So, how can I help you?
Phoebe: I don't know. 
Phoebe: I'm sorry I can't give you an answer. I don't know if I'll ever have one. 
Phoebe: But maybe you can help me with that. 
Lucy: I'd like that.
<<make Lucy normal>>
Lucy: As long as you let me know what you feel, I can handle it, you know? Even if you feel like being alone. 
Lucy: I like you when you're happy and I like you when you're struggling.
